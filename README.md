### 19AI405 FUNDAMENTALS OF ARTIFICIALINTELLIGENCE
## Laboratory Experiments
Dear Learners, I have created a GITHUB repo of Lab Experiments. There are about 8 Experiments, each present in a Folder with description and a Python Program associated with it.

You can download the Program and Execute and a Sample Screenshot can be taken and added to the Records.

These are the List of Experiments

1. Implement Depth First Search Traversal
2. Implement Breadth First Search Traversal
3. Implement A* Search Algorithm
4. Implement Simple Hill Climbing Algorithm
5. Implement Minimax Search Algorithm
6. Implement alpha-beta Pruning Algorithm
7. Solve Cryptarithmetic Problem
8. Implement Wumpus world Problem.

# Note: 
Just Python with IDLE in windows is more than sufficient for Execution of Programs. No third-Party Libraries are used.
